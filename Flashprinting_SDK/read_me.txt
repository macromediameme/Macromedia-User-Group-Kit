ReadMe for Macromedia Flash 4 Print Authoring SDK
January 2000
============================================

Welcome to Macromedia Flash 4 Print Authoring SDK! 

You can use the new printing features of Macromedia's Flash Player to print catalogs, coupons, information sheets, receipts, or invoices from Flash movies. This SDK provides documentation and tips on how to prepare new Flash movies and update existing Flash movies to make the best use of Flash Player printing.

In this folder, you will find three items.

1. "Flashprint.pdf"
This is the documentation file that instructs you how to author printing Macromedia Flash movies. You will need the Acrobat Reader to print this document.

2. "Ad_Banner_Example"
This folder contains an example of a printing Flash application. It is fully explained in the "ad_banner.html" within the same folder, as well as in the "Flashprint.pdf" documentation.

3. "Detection_Example"
This folder contains an example of a mechanism for detecting if an externally loaded movie has been fully downloaded for printing. Although this is not documented in "Flashprint.pdf," you may view the actions contained in the frames of the actions layer in the included Flash file.
